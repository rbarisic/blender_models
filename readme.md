#Free Blender Models by R. Barisic

This repo is a work in progress. I'll configure 2 branches, master and wip (work-in-progress).
The goal of this repo is to toss up some of my 3d models as I get better and help people bootstrap their 3d scenes.

## License

All these models are free to use, but you **must** a) credit me, b) link back to this repo or c) link to http://www.xrlabs.de . Why? Because I want to know what cool things you create with these models :)

## Commercial Use
These models are not free for commercial use, including passively benefitting from their use, e.g. via ad-sponsored apps, freemium games, and anything that is non-profit. If you still want to use them for your commercial projects, please contact me about licensing.
